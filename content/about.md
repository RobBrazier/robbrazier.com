title: About Me

Hi, I'm Rob Brazier. I'm currently working at Barclays as a Cloud Engineer but have experience writing code in a variety of languages
such as PHP, JavaScript, Java, Python (oldest to newest)

As much as I'd love to say I'm a Full Stack developer, I can't say I've put much time into frontend stuff, mainly focusing on backend APIs/services,
but I'm trying to keep that area alive with svelte-awesome (to try and keep myself in that world)

Feel free to contact me via email (link on the [homepage](/))

I'll probably start writing some stuff in the blog here soon...
