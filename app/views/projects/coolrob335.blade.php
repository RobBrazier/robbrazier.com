<p>coolrob335.com was my first venture, started in 2011, to be home for the videos from my YouTube Channel</p>

<p>It has had many redesigns over the past few years, and has recently been moved off of WordPress (shock horror!), and now runs on Kirby, which is a flat-file CMS, and now the site loads at lightning speed!</p>
